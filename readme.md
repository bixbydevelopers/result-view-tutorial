  <h1 align="Center">Find A Pet Result View Tutorial Capsule</h1>
</p>

## Overview

This tutorial capsule is designed to demonstrate how to use result-views, both with a list and a details page. This capsule goes with this [Youtube tutorial video](https://youtu.be/eX2-kRkokMI):

The `master` branch of this repository matches the code at the beginning of the video. If you would like to code along with the video, download this code from the master branch and put it inside Bixby Studio.

The `completed` branch of this repository matches the code at the end of the tutorial video along with some added comments and file organization.

The `master` branch starts with the default lack of UI:

After going through the tutorial, your capsule will look like this, which also matches the `completed` branch:
